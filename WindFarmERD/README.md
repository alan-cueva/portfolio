# Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for Wind Farm Management System

## 2. Learning Objectives
By the end of this exercise, students should be able to:
- Understand the principles of Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs).
- Identify key entities, attributes, and relationships for an offshore wind farm.
- Translate real-world operational data into a structured data model.
- Present a clear ERD that could support BI applications in renewable energy.

## 3. Task Description
Offshore wind farms involve complex operations, including turbines, maintenance schedules, energy production, and environmental monitoring.

Your task is to create a logical ERD representing the data structure for offshore wind turbines. Consider the following elements:
- Entities: Include 5–8 core entities.
- Attributes: Each entity should include 2–5 key attributes. Include attribute data types for all fields.
- Relationships: Include at least 5 relationships, covering at least one one-to-many and one many-to-many (via junction table). Clearly indicate cardinality and participation (mandatory or optional) for each relationship.
- Keys: Clearly indicate primary keys and foreign keys where appropriate.
- Constraints: Include 2-3 relevant business rules and data constraints
- Normalisation: Organise tables to reduce redundancy and anomalies, aiming for at least 3NF where practical.

Additional Challenge:
- Briefly explain how your ERD could support Business Intelligence applications, such as predictive maintenance, performance monitoring, or operational optimisation.

## 4. Deliverables
- A digital poster in .pdf format displaying the ERD with entities, attributes, relationships, and keys.
- A brief note explaining how the ERD could support BI applications.
